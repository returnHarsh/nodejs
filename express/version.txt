 version

 4.18.2

 1st part -> 4
 2nd part -> 18
 3rd part -> 2

  3rd part (last part) -> minor fixes(optional)
  when you update something small and fixes minor bugs then you update the last (3rd part version)

  2nd part  - Recommended bug fix (secure )
  latest -> 18 

  3rd part - Major release


  last one - > optional
  second one -> you have to do
  first one -> very major / breaking update , its recommended not to update it because it'll break your code , never change your first version in existing code 

  express : "^4.18.2"
  now lets talk about that carrot symbol "^"
  it lock the major version i.e 4
  but it can update the 2nd and 3rd version i.e 18.2
  but it will not go to version 5

  so the second and third is variable and npm can update it automatically
  but npm id not allowed to update the major version


  "~"
  this means to lock first and second version but npm can chnage the last(optional) version
  eg: "~4.18.2"
  so 4 and 18 got locked but npm can update 2 automatically
