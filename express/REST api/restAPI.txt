REST API 

full name is Restfull API
there are some rules that you have to follow rest apis 

1 first rule
"server and client archietecture"
it says that the server and client are different entity and dono ko ek dusre pe dependent nahi hona cahiye

2nd rule 
respect all methods
get , post ,  get , put , delete

jis metod ka jo kaam h vo wahi method kare
eg lots of user uses only for get and post 
if they want to delete , put or patch they still use post for that kind of work
but in REST method we uses all the method
